If you are floating your bridge and want the most out of your springs than these are the way to go.', \"Works great as a guitar bench mat. Not rugged enough for abuse but if you take care of it, it will take care of you. Makes organization of workspace much easier because screws won't roll around. Color is good too.\", \"We use these for everything from our acoustic bass down to our ukuleles. I know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.\\n\\nThe greatest benefit has been when writing music at the computer and needing to set a guitar down to use the keyboard/mouse - just easier for me than a hanging stand.\\n\\nWe have several and gave one to a friend for Christmas as well. I've used mine on stage, and it folds up small enough to fit right in my gig bag.\", \"Great price and good quality.  It didn't quite match the radius of my sound hole but it was close enough.\", \"I bought this bass to split time as my primary bass with my Dean Edge. This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy.\", \"it's more on toy side than on instrument side, and made in Indonesia.\\n\\npro\\nin tune\\nfun to play with\\nsmall and easy to carry around\\nsolid built\\ncheap\\n\\ncon\\ncan't handle fortissimo, no loud notes\", 'Absolute BEST guitar hangers on the market... You will not beat this price! Buy them while you still can for this cheap', \"Great nylon strings, just as expected. They worked just fine on my daughter's mini classical guitar. They are as good quality wise as much more expensive strings I've purchased in the past. They are much softer to the touch and easier for her to learn on than my steel strings on my acoustic guitar. They came labeled with both the note name and the string number, which made putting them on easy and quick.\", 'I bought this stand for church because I been blessed with a soprano and a alto sax and its realy good and reliable and fit in the front poutch of my sax case with no problems (my alto case has a exstra poutch in the front) but one little thing is that the peg can fit a soprano but its just a little lose but it still is safe for soprano sax.', 'Awesome stand!\\n\\nTip: The bottom part that supports the guitar had a weird angle when arrived, making the guitar slide back, becoming almost 100% on a vertical.\\nTo solve this, I assembled the product and the put a some pressure on the support frame, making it bend a little. Now my guitar sits perfectly. Check photos!', 'I gave a cheaper neck a shot. I am blown away by the look of this neck. The stain used is just enough to highlight the grain nicely and the clear coat is darn near perfect. I figured a lot of time would be during the \"adjustment\" phase of the build. Nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. What a pleasant surprise since in past builds I\\'d spent an hour or more getting them set. I\\'ve used Fender and Warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. The proof had been in the pudding though. This neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. No problems. I use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs.

I think they are direct knock-off of Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Model Humbucker Pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex \"EMG-ish\"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review.', \"Its a pick holder. It does what its supposed to. I mainly use Fender medium picks, and have a few Fender heavy picks around. I don't have any thin picks. Itll hold 6 heavy picks or 9 medium picks. I would imagine it would hold 11 or 12 thin picks.\", 'kinda flimsy but oit does the job', \"This is a fine EQ.  It sounds good and I'm  thinking of getting another one  for right and left  speaker.\", \"Over the period of a month, one of the two cables failed. When I unplugged it, the actual quarter inch end broke off as I was pulling the cable out as I normally do at the end of practicing or a show, and got stuck in my amp so thanks to this, I have to spend money and time that I don't have to get my amp fixed with the broken cable and buy a better, stronger, more durable cable that won't break when I pull it out of the amp.\", 'This Gator guitar hanger is sturdy, attractive, and easy to install.  It comes with wall anchors for drywall, and long screws.  The hangers are rubber coated to prevent finish damage.  The instructions are simple and I had this installed in under 5 minutes.  There are no screws visible once the unit is on the wall.  I was initially worried that the guitar would hang too close to the wall, however it is a good 3.5\" away.  It did take some \"oomph\" to get the actual hanger prongs parallel to the floor, but it certainly feels solidly locked in.  I was fortunate enough to have a location where a stud was available (and I would highly recommend using a stud for the install), however 2 heavy duty screw-in wall anchors also come with the unit for drywall mounting.  I much prefer this clean look to having the guitar on a floor stand in the corner where it tends to gather dust and dog hair. Ugh.', \"I bought this item because it had good reviews and it was cost effective compared to the top name brands. So far I have only used this item in a practice setting, but it does exactly as it states. I have noticed if the product is left on for several hours it gets a little warm, but it doesn't seem to be any sort of issue\\n\\n12V and 18V out allows for easy hookup into those oddball pedals (just make sure you don't plug your 9V pedal into one of those slots).\\n\\nI would recommend this item to anybody compiling their first pedal board. I know you can just pop a 9V battery in most pedals and away you go, but...\\n\\nRunning the cost comparison of this power supply to 9V batteries makes it pretty obvious that this power supply is worth every penny. Plus you never have to worry about a dead battery in your loop ruining a gig.\", 'You really cant beat it for the price, however, I would not use it for really heavy lights. Its only rated for 50lbs anyway. If you have some LED fixtures, a couple lasers (attached picture).... then this is perfect. Heavy scanners, and other large format lights (even if only using one ~40 lbs) I would not use. It only feels secure enough for a couple smaller lights and a fogger. Just buy it!!! You could always use it in your entertainment center and or, mobile DJ rig for some sort of light application.', 'I have never used AKG microphones before. I decided to take a chance on this from all the great reviews. They were right! I used this to record a Taylor 914CE, the sound was chrisp, great mid and just enough low to not overpower the sound. I totally recommend this for vocals and acoustic guitar recording!', \"It's hard to give less than 5 stars because this light is just an amazing value. It packs a serious punch in terms of output and feels quite sturdy. It has a very thin profile and the housing is a thick rugged plastic. Mounting hardware feels smooth and easy to adjust. The display on the back is larger than other lights of this style which is nice when configuring DMX channels. I control mine via a software DMX system, so I can't speak for the built-in modes. It has worked flawlessly in a DMX environment.\\n\\nI was curious how this light would perform vs. the more expensive 4-in-1 style, and to my surprise the color-mixing is very smooth and has very litle 'rainbow' effect when used as a wash/uplight. I recently played a gig at a winery and used this light for back-lighting the stage. This light is on the rear-left in the attached pictures, with the GBGS 8Wx9 on the right.\\n\\nPotential cons: Hard-wired power cord, somewhat loud fan ( not noticeable in a live music context )\", \"I really love the fretwraps, they're really usefull, specially when you need to record something and want a really clean sound, or when you are a bass player that loves the slapping technique. After i got my first set, i liked it so much that i ended up buying it in different colors!\", 'I wanted to customize my fake plastic rock band guitar&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Beatles-Rock-Band-X360-Wireless-Rickenbacker-325-Guitar-Controller/dp/B0028N13GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Beatles: Rock Band X360 Wireless Rickenbacker 325 Guitar Controller</a>&nbsp;with inexpensive tuning pegs. These fit the bill and I\\'m happy with the end result.\\nPictures of finished project uploaded in uploaded customer images.\\nHowever, if I needed tuning pegs on my real guitar, I would surely go with a better choice. Pay a little more for better quality.', 'These went on my new Strat a day after my white Strat came home. The only reason is for you! Changing strings in no time. Do they do anything else, nope.', 'Perfect Fit!! Color match is very close.  Great product!! Added pickguard to a Les Paul Studio Deluxe..', 'Very stable and sturdy.... Well worth the $$ to protect your expensive gear', \"I've been playing for 9 years and was worried this won't be on par with the mid-end guitar I've been using. The guitar both looks and feels great. The finish is very well done. It's got a warm and full sound to it that I really enjoyed, that at times I found myself reluctant to stop playing. And I was really pleased with how smooth the fretting was, it felt like it took less effort to move between the frets and press down than on several guitars I've played on previously.\\n\\nThe only gripe I have is that the fret position markers (dots) are really dark and hard to spot (see pictures). But that's not a deal breaker by any means, since when playing you would normally look at the markers on the side of the neck, which were pretty clear. Still, aesthetically the dark markers don't look as nice.\\n\\nBut overall I was quite impressed, especially for such a great price. You know a guitar is good when it encourages you to play more often again, and makes it hard to stop and put it down.\", \"Gamechanger mixer. One of the few things that has been made in this century that is decent. I use it in a studio rack that replaced a Mackie 1202VLZ, a Yamaha REV500 DSP and a Behringer 31 band DEQ2496. Was a little reluctant to replace all these devices, but over time I gave in as I learned/experimented more with this mixer. I control it with an IPAD Air 2- prefer it over Android as I can place the RTA, the EQ and the channel strip all on the same screen without having to toggle. My only small gripe is that updates and development of the IOS XAir app have not been much of a priority (2 years between 1.42 and 1.5?) . It can be a little overwhelming- after 6 months, I'm still learning more about it and that's a good thing- they'res stuff I can do with this mixer that I could not do with any analogue mixer I've had/used. Love the idea that I can take the IPAD and roam.\", \"Great product and price. I bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as I don't do much live recording there. There is definitely a difference and the early reflections from the monitors are lessened (to my ears anyway). They did the job I needed and they look good too! I opted to pin them to the wall with t-pins instead of using adhesive. For my use it works well and I can remove them with little or no damage to the wall. I ordered a second box to put in a pattern on the one remain wall that could use some treatment.\\n\\nIf you are looking for acoustic foam absorption panels, take a look at these.\", \"It's really flexible on how you're planning to put on top of it. The only small con is the top surface, you might wanna get a cheap Ikea board for it so you can throw anything. I put my guitar amp head (around 40lbs I think), and two monitor speakers without a problem. Love it!\", 'Works nicely on my guitar thanks.', \"I had read another review in here from someone using this with the MXL V67G after popping out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade screwdriver, so I took a chance and ordered one for myself.  That guy was 100% correct! I just popped out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade and my V67G slipped right in and could be tighly secured using the black mounting ring supplied with the V67G.\\n\\nI had read a lot of negative reviews about the MXL shockmount for this microphone so I didn't want that one.  This shockmount bears a striking resemblance to the MXL 890 shockmount that came standard with my 890 vocal mic and with the same quality of construction.  The price is definitely more than fair for what you get here!\\n\\nSo... If you have an MXL V67G order with confidence!  I would say that this would be a much better choice than the MXL alternative.\\n\\nI was also blown away how fast Amazon got this thing to me!  I ordered it last night and it showed up on my front porch this afternoon!\", 'Works & sounds beautifully. Would recommend this to anybody!', \"Thus should be a 5 star review, but sadly, it's only a 3. I bought a cymbal off of eBay that was a mess. I got it for next to nothing and figured I would clean it up. Cleaner sure worked well and then THANKFULLY I read to not use on the Letters. Holy cow I was this close to cleaning up those areas when thankfully someone called me and I read the entire bottle to the very end.\\n\\nSo the finished product is what you see. A far better cleaned up cymbal but still looks like a wreck around the Letters. Oh well. Light years better than the eBay mess I bought. But I sorely wish I could clean around the lettering with no fear of losing the lettering. You would think Zildjian would be able to make a cleaning product that works well around the Letters, no?\", 'This light is awesome!!! Very bright with 54 one watt diodes. Throws a nice medium wash they are great. The only down side I have with them is a power cable being attached to the fixture instead of an iec cable. It has dmx in and out. The housing is a very tough plastic and also includes the hanging bracket. The par is a flat par which is great for up lighting. I think this is a great fixture so I give it a 5 stars', 'these capos are easy to use, high quality materials, flawless mecanism, adjustable pressure, an investment for a life. Just be know that there are two versions:\\n Perfomance 1 (discontinued) : Extremely nice pressure and good looking, a little bulky, but non intrussive, the best choice for long scale guitar (25.4\").\\nPerformance 2 (new version) : light and narrow, easy to handle with one hand, the only con is that It lacks a little in pressure (compared to P1). i will use It in a short scale (24.9\") guitar.\\npd: i have only try It on my acoustic 25.4 scale Martin 1 3/4 \" neck. i own both and i love the Performance 1 better. Look at the pics to see the differences between both.', \"I bought It to storage my Epiphone Les Paul Standard, It fits perfect, the inside is soft, this case provides a great protection, It's a little heavy, but I think this is the best choice for a epi LP.\", \"This USB guitar/instrument cable lets you connect an electrical musical instrument to a PC directly through the USB port. This takes a few minutes to auto-install the drivers when you plug it in. Once installed it worked smoothly. It seems to be solidly constructed and it fits fine on both the USB plug and the guitar. Take note that it was listed on my computer as a headphone device rather than an instrument cable, so don't get confused by how it is listed in the USB devices. I would say this is worth trying if you want a USB musical instrument cable. I received a discounted sample for my honest, unbiased review.\", 'I was surprised when I discovered this mic delivers XLR quality recording. I originally bought it for recording sessions during travel but it stacks up well against a 2x as expensive Rhode XLR mic! I would definitely recommend this mic to anyone looking for a good USB mic.', 'I took me some time to get set right, now I really like it.', \"I loved this guitar stand at first b/c it held my Guild & Martin acoustics securely. After about a year of stationary use, the plastic housing which was responsible for holding up the neck support cracked and cannot be repaired (see pics). Since I'm past any warranty period, I'm stuck.\\n\\nAdditionally, all of the rubber developed a gummy residue which was sticky to the touch. I often had to go try to wash it off after touching it, even accidentally. I had a Hercules mic stand which developed a similar problem before it also broke.\\n\\nGave it a 2-star review because I got a year of use out of it, but I probably won't buy another Hercules product.\", \"This pair of Samson GT Studio Monitors was a great start for me, they aren't your loudest speakers, but they still pack a punch. They can still be mixed on, and give a good all around frequency response. What you want to be careful of is the bass, and mixing bass on these because they will not provide all of the bass that is really there. They are great for mids. The portability is amazing! Along with the fact that you will NOT need an audio interface with these! The Mic plugs directly into the speaker! What a easy and accessible way for an artist to record his vocals, or for a guitarist to to record his notes. Definitely a good investment!\", \"Awesome stand. Best one I've ever had. It's not that heavy easy to carry in maneuver. The push adjustment for the up-and-down is great quick and easy holds really good. Feels like it's going to last a long time without being overly heavy. I really have no complaints thing works great. I did put a counterweight cuz my tube recording mic is kind of heavy.. wish I could buy 20 for 50 bucks. Wish they had a deal for multiple...\", \"Bought two of these at the same time and one arrived broken in two spots. The adjustment screw was missing on the base (see photo) and the one for the top part was stripped out.  Both screws are made of plastic with some kind of cheap pot metal fittings that likely don't take much force to break.\\n\\nIt's a 20 mile drive to the nearest UPS store to return these or I have to pay for pickup.  It wasn't worth it for something that costs $15 so I drilled a small hole and tapped a small screw into it.  If I had an easier option to return it, I would and get something else.  The one that wasn't broke on arrival works well but I'm not holding my breath it will last long or survive falling over more than once.\", \"I have a 1950s Fender tweed amp, so I wanted to get this strap to match it. It is a perfect match! The leather on the ends is a bit lighter than in the product picture, but it's fine. I love that the stripe is Fender tweed, which any musician should recognize. It's not garish -- it's a subtle statement. The feel of the fabric is nice, and it isn't too stiff like some straps are. All in all, it was a good purchase.\", \"a little higher up than I thought it would be, but nice that I got my pedal board running a little under my amp, now i don't kick my amp when i go to switch effects.  Wish there was more adjustability but it is what it is, one of the more affordable stands can't be asking too much.  The back power plug socket on my amp (Bugera v5) barely interferes with the back bar of the stand (bottom of the plug hitting top of the bar) but I got the weight of the amp slightly resting on it and I don't think it's severe enough that it's a danger.  Stand won't be moved around much so  I expect it to last for a long long time.\", \"These strings were reccomended to me by an acquaintance of mine during a bass clinic I attended recently.  I ordered them right away.. All i can say is WOW! Excellent tone. It really brightened up my sound. I had gotten used to muddy sounding strings.  I haven't noticed a sticky feeling like others have mentioned, mine are silky smooth. Great playability. Wasn't too concerned about color, But When I installed them on my Ferrari red Carvin LB 70, I fell in love with my bass all over again.  It looks stunning, and I get many comments about my bass now..Others have mentioned that the color wears off quickly, but I don't care, I'll used the color wear as a guage of when to change them..Then neon ones even glow brightly under a black light.  Bass players don't get much credit so why not give them a show and something to talk about.\", \"I have 3 of these now and I like that I can fit any type of guitar on there at the same time, even if they have straps on them. I have other stands that are spaced closer together and even a tremolo bar can get in the way. For those who have complained about no instructions being included, there are two bolts and 4 wheels. If you can't figure that out then maybe putting stuff together isn't your thing.\\n\\nI like that the supports are rubber and not foam. I do have one of the 3 that has a weak bottom brace and makes the guitar tilt a bit. Only noticeable if you are that kind of person.\", 'My husband got Guitar Hero for Christmas and on a whim added one of these hangers to his wish list.  One of our friends got it for us, almost as a joke-- but then we mounted it and realized how handy it was!  It works wonderfully for our little plastic guitar, saves it from getting scratched up in the closet, and looks pretty darn cool.  Highly recommended!', 'I purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. These are well made and certainly do the job okay. However, I completely did NOT trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. They are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. I was not about to trust my vintage P-Bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. No, I used a heavier \"construction screw\" directly into a wall stud. See photo. I was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. If you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. I\\'m probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  Other than that, I like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).', \"Thickest and most durable beater patch on the market. Buy this even if you don't use Aquarian heads. It'll prolong the life of any head!\", \"It's inexpensive. It's comfortable. It is not leather.\", 'I installed a set of these on my Epiphone G400 Pro. They offer better prevention of guitar straps slipping off than the stock strap buttons provide. These pins also have a lower profile than the stock pins. They are a single piece pin, versus strap lock that have two pieces that lock together. Installation was very easy and the provided hardware fit with no issues. These strap pins give me piece of mind and they look awesome too!', \"Just got my pedal board yesterday!  I love it.  Before I had my pedals strewn all over the floor.  Now they're organized and easier to use.  The board is larger than I expected b/c I didn't pay attention to the measurements in the description.  But I'm glad I chose this one.  It gives me an excuse to purchase more pedals.  Obviously the stock photo shows many pedals placed really close together which is not realistic considering the cables that are involved.  I'm attaching photos of my board for better reference.  Eventually, as I add more pedals I will place the power supply under the board, but for now I like the blue illumination of the AGP power supply.\\n\\nI definitely recommend this board as it is very sturdy and comes with everything you need to set it up.  I had a blast configuring my simple set up!  Rock on fellow musicians!\", \"This added the je ne sais quoi to my PA sound.\\n\\nHelps with vocals a lot - and smooths out the guitars through FOH.\\n\\nI have used BBE for many years and wouldn't play out without one.\", \"I love this thing, I've used it for so many events now.\\n\\nEasy to plug into a locations system equal everything out and get your own sound and mix\", \"Not much to say here - they're knobs. They look good, are well made and fit perfectly on the CTS pots in my guitar.\", \"I actually picked up this bass at my local guitar center used, for $60! I brought it home, wiped it down with some dunlop guitar polish, cleaned and treated the fretboard with lemon oil, and put on a D'Addario Light set of strings. I have $75 invested, and it plays amazing! I've played it through numerous cabs, and record with it. Very happy. Check through the used section at GC first if you don't mind a quick cleaning and restring to save you $125!\", \"Really tough sound. Made out of plastic but it's both overdrive and distortion and everything in between.\", \"The picture doesn't do this bridge justice, I was skeptical of the quality when I ordered this Tremolo bridge but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. I wasn't so concerned with the quality because I planed on using it on an old broken down imported Kramer ST300 that I refinished. I gave it a 3 because of the screws it takes a lot of hand strength to get the screws seated. You have to be very careful that you don't strip the philip screw heads the screw driver doesn't quit fit the number 2. I'll take the guitar to my shared work shop to see if a larger screw driver fits better.\", 'Worked great to level the frets on my 45 yr old Epiphone FT-150 acoustic guitar!', \"I bought the classical guitar case. It fits my Ruben Flores 1200 perfectly. I had my doubts for the low price. It's very solid constructed. It comes with two keys for a lockable latch. It has a nice surface texture that feels like leather. The whole thing feels really well-built.\", 'This would be my fourth Ocarina Wind ocarina. It is by far my FAVORITE. I love the \"Sound of Earth\" design. The mouthpiece is perfectly sized. The body design is very comfortable and feels natural to hold. The rough finish makes it feel sturdy and adds some nice grip! The slight indent at the subholes makes it very easy and comfortable to use them.

Checking Amazon, I saw this stand, which at the time of my order was $20.00 even.  It seemed like a great value, so I ordered it.  The packaging was a little flimsy, but the stand arrived in one piece and in good condition.  It fit my Gaia perfectly.  The included straps don\\'t work with the Gaia, but the stand holds the keyboard well, and at the right height.

I was looking for a hard case that had a pair of backpack straps, which this model does. I don't know if all the colors have that, but I was told that the red, white and champagne colored cases have the removable backpack straps. The straps are also nicely padded.

So, I took it and put it on my Ibanez AS93 (a fairly heavy guitar for being semi-hollow) and they fit, perfectly. I had just done a string change and spent a little over an hour playing and breaking the strings in, this strap is super comfy (especially for not being padded).

I did not like the new guitars, they did not sound the way I remember them. I walked out of my favorite music stores with out any guitar. My friend told me to try a Canadian made guitar a Seagull. I never heard of them. I saw a few for sale used, that's good because I wanted an old one. I tested a 1996 S6 Seagull and the sound, power and tone from this guitar was fantastic.

I never realized how much amp hiss I was getting until I plugged these in for the first time.  I had to actually hit a string to make sure it was working.  I can not say enough good things about these affordable pickups.  I have another MIM strat with some boutique pickups that are marketed as noiseless but I honestly believe I actually like the tone of these better for a fraction of the cost.

I have never seen these in my retail shops. I just ordered from here. After putting in a 9V battery and plugged in my Gretsch guitar, instantly I heard the punching sound of rockabilly. Never did I ever heard any strange sounds of feedback or popping or screeching. It was quiet and perfect for me even when I played it real close to the amp. I did not purchase the DC adaptor, just relying on batteries. Imagine I could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! The bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad. The brand name of the amp is located at its back, kind of shy of telling others it's Fender. At first I suspected it was fake. However the sound doesn't lie. I realized this amp cost more than the others, not sure if other brands are equally good as well.\", 'Great look. Great product. Great buy!!!!', \"Installed these in my Ibanez  AS53 with no problem.  Probably not the application intended by the mfg, as they are intended to replicate active metal pickups.

There simply doesn\\'t seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.  A few trips over the power cord could easily compromise the integrity of the adapter, AC plug and/or your outlet.  I have not yet decided whether or not to keep this.', \"Love the blue glow of the power supply on my pedal board.  I've only had it for a day so I don't know how it will hold up, but i'm sure it will be fine.  Comes with all of the cables to fully power your pedal board.  The A/C adapter cable is only 3 feet long so consider buying an extension chord or power strip to plug it into.\", 'Work well for a very reasonable price. Arms are padded well, so no damage to the neck or head.\\nAs others have stated perhaps going into a stud with longer screws is more stable for heavier guitars. I went with a two inch wood screw into studs and these worked quite well.', 'The cover is very beautiful, mainly the interior. One con I find is that it is too heavy and uncomfortable to transport.\\nThe main reason why I rate it with 1 stars is that the first week of use (very careful) one of the hinges broke.

They\\'ll be fine.\\n\\nOne thing to note, per the product description:\\n\"High Quality Multi color foam for ball shape microphones.\"\\n\\nSomehow I missed that line before purchasing. These will fit nicely on an SM-58 or other handheld mic with a ball-type grill. They will slide right off an SM-57 or similar shaped mic. That\\'s not a defect, just something you want to know. But at ~$2.00 for a five-pack, I have zero complaints.\\n\\nAnd they WILL work on a straight shaped mic with the aid of a hair-tie, rubber band, gaff tape, etc. For size reference, see pic. I have the blue one on an SM-57. I even managed to get the yellow one to stretch over a Sennheiser e609 (this is of questionable usefulness, since it\\'s pretty much exclusively an instrumental mic, but I figured I\\'d see if I could). They also fit well on my condenser mic (second pic), though they aren\\'t as substantial as the foam cover that came with it.\\n\\nAll in all, would highly recommend these.', 'This is a beautiful capo, and with the action on my guitar I can use it anywhere after moving it a bit, a five star product', 'Excellent, clear, punchy, great note definition. 60s rock, 70s R&B, modern jazz, this set covers it all.

I have done my radio show with it exclusively for the past 8 months and love it!  This mic ROCKS!  This microphone has XLR connections so be sure to use good mixer with those standard connections for a top quality mic like this.

I replaced the original neck position humbucker on my 1980 Les Paul (which I bought new) with a SPH90 Phat Cat.  What a difference!!  It is MUCH louder, and brighter, and all around sweeter and more tuneful that the original.  I used to rarely use the neck pickup alone.  Now I'll use it almost exclusively (though mixing in a bit of the bridge humbucker is sweet too).  I'm very glad I bought this and made the switch.  P.S. - I've had no problem with hum from this pickup - if you do, your problem is probably somewhere in your amp.\", \"All I have to do is install this on my Strat.

I didn't time myself but couldn't have taken more than 1 hour. Playing this guitar is much better now even though the E and e strings are close to the edge of the fretboard. I have less problem placing my fingers cause the strings seem to have a wider spread, I didn't measure this, it's all feel.

The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place.

As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on.

Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\", \"Does everything I need it to do, gets the instrument out of the way, on but not against the wall and in a good place to be seen.

I got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the Shu (see photos). I used the May no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the Kelly Shu.

The molded interior fits my Fender Jazz Bass like a glove and I feel it's secured at all times.  This is the second case I've owned and the quality is superb!  It balances much better in my hand while carrying it than my last case which was a bit front heavy.  It's also lighter in weight than my previous case too.  The open compartment is deep enough to fit my cable, strap, tuner, accessories and I usually throw my amp power cable in there too.  I also like that the open compartment does not have a door that you always have to open or close.  Just open the case and everything is there for easy access.  Lastly, cosmetically this case is very sweet looking.  The black, white and chrome details are perfect and of course the chrome Fender logo on the top of the case really sets it off.\", \"We used this one in the middle as seen in the picture holding the white guitar. BIG MISTAKE! The guitar almost was destroyed. This is NOT strong enough to hold a 7 string Schecter Omen guitar. While it worked out and seemed secure at first. Literally 7 days later the guitar had almost fell to the floor. I wouldn't recommend this for heavier guitars. Instead we will be keeping the guitar in the stand where it is safer.\", \"Sound is clear and crisp, bowl is beautiful and a good weight.  Love the little pillow.

You will not regret it!', 'Well built, all metal construction, It\\'s capable of holding 6 and possibly 7 smaller mics if you use the center mounting hole that goes over the mic stand, you can use a mic clip to hold the bar instead of the washer / nut. I use it to hold 4 large diaphragm condenser mics with shock mounts. It keeps me from having to swap mics for different vocalists when recording.  I just position the pop filter in front of the mic that is being used and mute the unused ones.  Sometimes I\\'ll actually leave the other mics on and record the simultaneous vocal takes across several mics to separate tracks. This gives me several \"flavors\" to add effects to without having the vocalist do individual takes on different mics.  It saves a lot of time when choosing a mic for a particular vocalist.', \"This is a great idea and I was surprised at how well the suction cup adheres to my guitar's surface.  However, if you are going to rely on it for a gig, then I would attach at least two as your hand or any brushing against something firm can knock it off.  In other words, it isn't as sticky as adhesive.  But, for most situations, it certainly does the trick and can removed in an instant and does not deface the guitar surface in any fashion.  It does come with a medium thickness, pink pick that is halfway decent.  While I am not crazy about the color, I quickly realized that it is easy to see against the strings and surface of the guitar.\", 'This pickup is a dream come true.

I saw the bad reviews for this guitar case and I can tell you that have not had a problem with either one of my cases.\", \"Perfect fit on my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Studio Faded.  I didn't like the original speed knobs because they were too big and clunky-feeling.

The finish is perfect on them:  No seams, scratches, chips, etc.  I don't know what more someone could expect quality-wise.\\n\\nThey also sit much closer to the body than the old speed knobs, so it's a cleaner look.\\n\\nI truly can't imagine why anyone would have any problem with these whatsoever if they're ordering for a USA-made Gibson.

The action is just right for me. The tone/sound is awesome. I hooked it up in my Vox amp and I have to say this thing really rocks.

I did all my online research, and tested many guitars at music shops. Some felt like works of art, flashy, shiny, with that dipped in plastic look and feel. The Jim Dandy looked old style with jumbo fret markers, and a satin type finish...I thought it was old! I strummed a few chords and it played ok. I liked the short size and bought a back pack style case. I ride my bike two miles with my guitar every day to jam with friends at the Marina. This Gretsch Jim Dandy kicks mine and everyone that hears or plays it's butt! It stays in tune and the sound it puts out, tho not too loud, is pure nostalgia at it's finest!

Also, it adjusts easily for travel and mallet through. It provides a distinct bass sound freeing up your two hands on the Cajon.

I currently own 2 other Dean guitars including a 12 string and I wanted to say that I bought this guitar based upon the reviews here on Amazon which I most often do. I have to admit I really like Dean humbuckers. This guitar did not disappoint.  It is beautiful, and that shiny chrome-like green neck with silver fret bars is awesome.  This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.  I really like these tuners because they a precise. It sounds awesome through my Zoom G5 effects pedal. I agree with the reviewer who said 'buy it now'.  You won't  be sorry.  This is now my main squeeze especially for anything rock. I recorded 4 Iron Maiden songs with it.  Sweet!!!!!!!!  I love this guitar. I just love it.  I can't say that enough.\", \"I bought 4 to use for my pedal board that I just made. Upon opening the first one, it was not one continuous piece. It was cut towards one end and as I unrolled it, a shower of the black mushroom nubs came falling out (see picture). Hmm...maybe just a bad roll. I opened the second one. This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal. I'm sure it would work fine, if you don't move things around, but just the idea that I can't do it do often doesn't sit well. Oh well, expensive lesson learned. Get the 3M instead. I have used it in the past. Good stuff.\", \"While I wasn't sure this would fit my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9, I was pleasantly surprised.

You are going to hear less sibilance from the vocals that are being recorded. I definitely will recommend this to every artist and/or mixing engineer to get a clean, quality recording. Its cheap, so the price will not be a big problem for you. You see a pop filter in most studios these days, and don't worry about yours not being the most expensive or the most advanced.

I have a TS9DX and TS9 that were made for Ibanez by Maxon in the 90\\'s that were modded to 808 spec, and this pedal sounds dead-on to that sound.\\n\\nThe sound has been kind of a blanket statement of \"transparent light to medium drive\". Like any Tube Screamer, this has a great drive on its own, can push an overdriven amp without adding color, and can stack well with other pedals. It\\'s definitely a smoother overdrive than other Tube Screamers or clones I have.\\n\\nThe pedal I\\'d compare this to the most would be the Ibanez TS808, obviously. The sounds of the 2 pedals are very similar, but the OD808 is a little smaller, has a normal stompswitch, and costs a little less than the TS808 Reissue. This is definitely the real deal by the company that\\'s been making Tube Screamers longer than anyone else. Definitely one of my favorites along with the Electro-Harmonix East River Drive.\\n\\nBottom line; the Maxon OD808 is what a Tube Screamer should sound like.', 'This is a great option for creating a lively, party-like atmosphere.

It has enough highs-lows-mids to make you smile.  The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.

The rocker neck rest from StewMac is ok, but it's completely useless if you need to flip a guitar over on it's face AND it'll fall over every time you don't need it to. This cradle is perfect in every way. Lots of options for height/angle and the ability to leave the guitar strung and temporarily lock them out of the way onto the lips on this cradle is very, very handy.\", \"This stand is perfect.

I have medium sized hands, and these picks can slip off my fingertip when it's hot and muggy, like when I'm playing at an outdoor market.

I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget.

I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls.

I have tried Pop's, Nyman, and Kolstein. I like Pop's and Kolstein the best. Pop's (when fresh) is the stickiest. Nyman is hard and powdery. Kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. There is something special in their formulation. I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away.

One black set and the other is gold. The first guitar would not stay in tune so I tried these. They have been on for nearly a year now and they totally fixed my tuning problem. The second set I put on my brand new Gibson Les Paul only because the first ones worked so well. Super easy fast string changes with the auto trim feature, and no tuning issues at all. At 18:1 gear ratio they dial in a perfect tune and hold it. I prefer these over Grover or any other higher priced tuners available.\\nI have added a few pictures. The new tuners covered the holes on my Les Paul so it looks great from the back. The Other is an Ibanez AR420.

Before you do this  run the  screw that attaches to the base through the threads to avoid any issues like the negative reviewer had. After you attach the base to the wall thread in the guitar hanger screw firmly and you are good to go.

I paired these with a Fender tweed strap, but maybe it is a little bit of overkill having the F sign everywhere (\"Ok ok we KNOW it is a Fender, come on!\"). They are kind of massive when installed, doesn\\'t look bad but just bulky. Only problem I had is that I had previously installed a set of Dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new Fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. So I had to use the previous Dunlop screws with the new Fender ones, and it worked like a charm. Not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later. Not as easy to lock into the guitar as other models, this one requires two fingers to adjust, instead of for instance Dunlops, with just a central button. Just be sure that your guitar is strapped when you let it go!', 'This case is rigid yet lightweight. There seems to be plenty of padding (high density Styrofoam?).  In regards to the various sizes, I bought the \"Electric\" size and it fits my new Fender Strat perfectly.  A Fender Strat fits snugly without shifting around.  NOTE:  If you have a Les Paul style guitar, make sure to buy the \"Les Paul\" case.  If you buy this Electric case, which is what I am reviewing here,  your Les Paul will NOT fit!  Inside the case there are a couple of areas where you can put a couple of effects pedals, etc.  If you use mini-pedals, you might be able to fit four.  On the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  Plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  The zippers are large and heavy duty.

At under twenty dollars you won't find many competitors, especially with this build quality. It is essentially an embroidery hoop with black pantyhose, an adjustable arm and screw clamp. Building one yourself will probably run you over twenty dollars and you will end up with an interesting mixture of distracting textures and colors, so why not just buy it instead? Functionally it works fine. It does muffle sound to some extent when stacked up against a metal mesh screen but for anything short of an audience of 50,000, it should appease just fine. all in all, if you are hitting annoying pops in your recording and don't want to spend a lot of money -- this is the way to go.\", \"Well...it plays perfectly, but the once clear, white on blue lettering rubs right off. Body's natural oils... rub whatever paint they use. I'm considering buying a perm marker in a bright color and drawing them on again. Yes, the gold side is embossed, so it won't rub off, but it's the blue on white that a person looks to for quickly identifying notes. Long-term, it's more about the pitches being stable/etc., but I'm disappointed that only after three uses, the lettering is rubbing off. Put a better finish on these things...coat it with something non-toxic, but non-reactive with oils/acids from people's fingers since that's what we'll be using when we hold the things.

It would have been nice to have more effects and greater control over their parameters.\\nIt sucks that the tone feature is only usable in 440hz tuning. Also the manual recommends placing it to the front of your effects chain, but If you've got pedals which don't play well with others like my Blackout Effectors Fuzz Bear, you should put it after those, as it tends to overdrive your output signal. With this having the functionality of a stompbox you'd want to mount it within your first line of pedals on your board for ease of switching, but the amount of cables running at the back takes up needed space if your pedal board is small .

I saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and I did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). This was not an issue for me, but I'd suggest checking for this.

I asked him if there was anything negative about it and he said all he can think of is how perfect it is.  You can adjuster mic volume, very clear, he has not heard any cut outs.

Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.

It's a bit louder that the Shure sm58, but not hugely.  Still needs quite a bit of preamp, about 70% up on my preamp to remain in unity on my mixer for reasonable recording levels.  It's got a good sound to it.  I think it's super short sighted of Behringer to fail to include the frequency profile of this microphone on the Amazon store page, but don't worry I've got you all covered.

Guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.\", 'Beautiful case with great padding and fit. The case is snug and absolutely perfect for my flamenco guitar.

Also, if you have smaller headstocks on your guitars or basses, you'll probably need to adjust the width of the holder with channel-locks or something similar that can squeeze the sides together.

Also there was a saw cut that went below the notch for the nut about 1/8and inch. Which is just poor quality workmanship.

I run it into a small cabinet with a Jensen Vintage C8R4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12\" x 12\" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  If you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a Fender Tweed combo from the 50\\'s.  I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it\\'s as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it\\'s perfect for the space.  I can\\'t believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you\\'re looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.', \"IMO this is the best and only way to mount toms, especially Pearls.  My Session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  I think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.  Most drummers buy, skin, and play for sound, but showing off your nice wood shells never hurts.  I can't think of a single negative, except that they're not free.  :)\", 'A great product, which made a wonderful under-bed light in our application.\\n\\n- Length is perfect for a kings size frame,  Start about 1 food from the headboard, and this will cover the permitter all the way around, with adjustment for your particular bed\\n\\n- The dimming feature is great and a must if you will use it for a nightlight application.

Is it perfect? No, but it is no less perfect than something costing a lot more and not sounding as good as this pedal. I read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like \"80\\'s glam rock.\" I totally disagree. If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound. I prefer a thicker creamy sound and you can dial that up with this pedal. For a mere $35, I was willing to roll the dice - I found a diamond in the rough.', 'Oh my word I am sold I love my AT2100 which Ive used for 5+ years for podcasting and YouTube BUT this thing is amazing for my current use case.

I did kind of dent the inside of a gold one as I put it on my squire, so you do have to be careful when installing. Also, as people have said, the black knobs have no hole in the chin to tighten or loosen.

It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.', 'Great Product, but there is no warranty in the USA when purchased from Amazon.\\n\\nI hope that I will never have to use the warranty for this amazing product, according to RODE (see screenshot), there is no warranty on RODE microphones when purchased from Amazon.com\\n\\nThis is a pity because this microphone is just great.', 'This product is good and is used in professional Mike Date .. fast shipping and worth buying']\n"
